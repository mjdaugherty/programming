			<b>Disclaimer</b>: I am not an expert or even an advanced Linux user. I know only the basics, so that will be the focus of this post.
			<br>
			<br>
			Linux has come a long way in the last 10 or 15 years. Gone are the days of spending hours reading posts on obscure message boards and searching for firmware - on the family computer, of course, since usually some of the drivers you were missing were for your laptop's wireless card. Still, the vast majority of personal computers today are running Windows or Mac, so many people performing data science or other programming-heavy tasks on their own computers don't have much experience with a Unix command line. By the way, Linux and Unix are not exactly synonymous: Linux is a Unix-like operating system, as is Mac, while Windows isn't. Therefore, Mac and Linux users can simply open up a terminal and use any of these commands, but the setup for Windows users is a little more involved.

			<b>Directory navigation</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			pwd: <u>p</u>rint <u>w</u>orking <u>d</u>irectory. Displays the absolute path to the directory (folder) in which you're currently working. This is really helpful when you get lost because you were in a hurry and gave crappy names to everything.
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjdaugherty/mjdaugherty.github.io/master/images/pwd2.png" alt="pwd">
			<br>
			<br>
			ls: <u>l</u>i<u>s</u>t. Prints a list of directories and files in the current working directory. By default it does <b>not</b> include hidden directories and files (these start with . on Linux systems), but by specifying -a you can show hidden items. -o gives more output, including the date and time that each item was last modified. Finally, if you specify either a relative or absolute path to a directory, ls will list the contents of that directory rather than the current working directory.
			<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			cd: <u>c</u>hange <u>d</u>irectory. With no arguments it will take you to your home directory; otherwise, give it a relative path to the directory you want to go to. cd ../ will move you up one level, and you can go up several levels at a time this way. If you try to give it a path to a file (like ./index.html, where ./ means "in the current directory") you'll get an error. In the image below, I start in images and move up two levels and back down one into Downloads. If you type ls and hit tab twice, as with any Unix command, you'll get a list of options for arguments you can specify.

			<b>Manipulating directories and files</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			touch: Create a file or files in the current working directory. To create several files, list them separated by spaces.
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjdaugherty/mjdaugherty.github.io/master/images/touch.png" alt="touch">
			<br>
			<br>
			rm: <u>r</u>e<u>m</u>ove. Remove files. <b>By default, you won't get a prompt asking if you're sure you want to remove the file before going through with it, so make sure you have the right one.</b> You can use -i to give you a prompt, but since it will just repeat the names of the files you just typed, it may not be very useful. You can use rm on directories too (see the entry for rmdir below).
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjdaugherty/mjdaugherty.github.io/master/images/rm.png" alt="rm">
			<br>
			<br>
			mkdir: <u>m</u>a<u>k</u>e <u>dir</u>ectory. Create a new empty directory or directories; analogous to touch. You can create a new directory and cd into it in one line using a semicolon (you can always execute multiple commands at once with this method).
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjdaugherty/mjdaugherty.github.io/master/images/mkdir.png" alt="mkdir">
			<br>
			<br>
			rmdir: <u>r</u>e<u>m</u>ove <u>dir</u>ectory. If there's anything in it, you will need to use rm -rf instead. You can remove several empty and non-empty directories together this way. This can be dangerous for obvious reasons, so make sure there's nothing in any of them that you need beforehand.
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjdaugherty/mjdaugherty.github.io/master/images/rmdir.png" alt="rmdir">
			<br>
			<br>
			mv: <u>m</u>o<u>v</u>e. Use mv to move a file or a directory to a new location. It will work even if the directory you're trying to move isn't empty, which will break any code that uses the old path to that directory. A non-obvious use of this command is renaming files: mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt will create newfile.txt, move the contents of oldfile.txt into it and remove oldfile.txt, producing the same effect as right click -> rename.
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjdaugherty/mjdaugherty.github.io/master/images/mv.png" alt="mv">
			<br>
			<br>
			cp: <u>c</u>o<u>p</u>y. Similar to mv except that the file you're copying is now in its original location as well as the location specified. Can be used to copy directories too, using -r.
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjdaugherty/mjdaugherty.github.io/master/images/cp.png" alt="cp">
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Other handy commands, notes</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			man: Prints the manual page for the command specified. Press q to exit. Really great if you want a quick list of all of the options you can give to a command, but for practical examples Google is usually more useful. Running man man will give you the man page for the man command. See what happens if you try running man man man!
			<br>
			<br>
			clear: Clears the output of your terminal. Usually better than opening a new window since you can scroll back up to see previously run commands.
			<br>
			<br>
			Note: * serves as a wildcard, so, for example, running rm -rf ./* will clear out everything in the current directory. This is an extremely bad idea because if you forget the period you will delete your entire filesystem and render your computer unusable (at least on Linux).
			<br>
			<br>
			That's all I've got for now. This is not even close to an exhaustive list of useful Unix commands, but it is most of the ones I use every day. I hope it was helpful. Thanks for reading.

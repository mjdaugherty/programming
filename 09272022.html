				This was the first long hike I went on, only a week after the fall equinox. The leaves hadn't begun changing colors yet and the sun was high. I wasn't sure how much food and water I would need, so I brought too much of both. Even though it was a weekday, there were a lot of other hikers on the trail. Being unused to walking in the mountains and carrying upwards of 15 pounds on my back made an already serious hike even more of a challenge. But the views were well worth the effort, and the famous (infamous?) rock scramble was a blast. Old Rag's reputation as one of the eastern USA's "bucket list" hikes is well-deserved.

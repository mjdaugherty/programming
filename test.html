		Welcome. My name is Mike, and I'm a data scientist and amateur astronomer with a passion for inspiring interest in the sciences. I've spent more than a decade looking through telescopes and making notes of the amazing things I saw, setting up in public spaces whenever I was able. My other interests include math, languages and programming. Data science, therefore, seemed like a natural choice. I recently completed 480 hours of instruction in subjects including machine learning, data visualization and natural language processing. This site is a showcase of some of the problems I have tackled using these and other skills.
